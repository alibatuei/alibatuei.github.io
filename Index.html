                    <li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Think of this as the "temporary" tense. It's for what's in progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Researchers and doctors <strong>are constantly pushing</strong> the boundaries of what was thought impossible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch Out!:</strong> Avoid using this for state verbs like `know` or `like`. Say "He <strong>knows</strong>," not "He is knowing."</li>
                    <li><strong>In Context:</strong> Groundbreaking treatments and therapies <strong>are being developed</strong> to tackle previously incurable diseases. Clinical trials and experiments <strong>are being conducted</strong> to assess the effectiveness of these innovative approaches.</li>

                    <li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Think of this as the "permanent" or "fact" tense. Signal words: <em>usually, always, every day</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The muscular system <strong>is</strong> one of the most important systems in the human body.</li>

                    <li><strong>Use:</strong> For a completed action at a specific, finished time in the past.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> If you can ask "When did it happen?" and get a specific past answer (e.g., *yesterday*, *last week*), use the Past Simple.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A 45-year-old male patient <strong>presented</strong> with a history of persistent pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch Out!:</strong> In questions and negatives, use `did` with the base verb, not the past form. (e.g., "**Did** you **report**?" not "Did you reported?").</li>
                    <li><strong>In Context:</strong> She <strong>reported</strong> that the rash <strong>began</strong> suddenly.

                    <li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Use this to "set the scene." It's the "long action" interrupted by a "short action" (Past Simple).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The patient <strong>was found wandering</strong> around the middle of the road.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch Out!:</strong> Some verbs like `know` or `want` are not used in the continuous.</li>

                    <li><strong>Watch Out!:</strong> Don't use this with finished time words. Say "The rash **began** several days ago," not "The rash has begun several days ago."</li>
                    <li><strong>In Context:</strong> In recent years, tremendous progress <strong>has been made</strong> in the field of creating artificial limbs.

                    <li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Ask "How long?" If the duration is the key information, this is often the right tense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> To improve my writing skills, I <strong>have been attending</strong> writing workshops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch Out!:</strong> To say *how many* or *how much* (the result), use the simple form. ("He **has made** progress," not "He has been making progress").</li>
